            <h1 class="page-header">Call for Artifacts</h1>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We invite all authors of papers accepted at ISSRE 2025 Research Track (REG, PER, and TAR papers) and Industry Track
                 (full papers only) to submit artifacts for Artifact Evaluation (AE), showcasing the reproducibility and quality of
                 your work, thereby illuminating the path of advancement and excellence in our field. You may also have the chance
                 to earn badges displayed on your papers in the conference proceedings, highlighting the credibility and rigor of your work.
                 Additionally, artifacts participating in the evaluation will be eligible to compete for the ISSRE 2025 Best Artifact Award,
                 acknowledging authors' endeavors in creating and disseminating exceptional research outcomes. Each submitted artifact will
                 undergo review by at least three members of the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).</p>

            <p>Before submitting your artifact, please review the information below. If you have any questions or concerns,
                you can contact the AEC chairs.</p>

            <h3><strong>Understanding Artifacts</strong></h3>

            <p>Artifacts encompass digital entities pivotal to research, spanning code or data, whether crafted by authors to bolster
                their investigations or generated throughout experiments. The AE process advocates for the transparent sharing of
                these artifacts, fostering open science principles and bolstering research reproducibility. Within the realm of software
                reliability, artifacts may encompass tools, data (such as logs or raw data), or a fusion of both. For instance, an Artifact
                Evaluation Package might comprise an executable tool alongside sample data to showcase its functionality. Note that, while you
                are encouraged to release the source code of your tools, you can also just release the executable binaries. Should you have any
                uncertainties regarding the eligibility of your artifact for the AE process, feel free to reach out to the AE Chairs for further
                guidance.</p>


            <h3><strong>Objectives of Evaluation and Badge Certification</strong></h3>

            <p>Aligned with IEEE standards, artifacts evaluation pursues three primary objectives:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="fw-bold">Available Badge</span>: The code and/or datasets, along with any associated data and documentation provided by the authors, should be
                    reasonable and complete. They should have the potential to support reproducibility of the published results.</li>
                <li><span class="fw-bold">Reviewed Badge</span>: The code and/or datasets, along with any associated data and documentation provided by the authors, should be
                    reasonable, complete, and capable of producing the outputs described in the paper. It should also support reproducibility of the
                    published results.</li>
                <li><span class="fw-bold">Reproducible Badge</span>: This badge signifies an additional level of certification. It indicates that an independent party has successfully
                    regenerated computational results using the research objects, methods, code, and analysis conditions created by the authors.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To earn the Reviewed badge, authors must also obtain the Available badge. Similarly, to earn the Reproducible badge, authors must obtain
                both the Reviewed and Available badges. Further details will be provided in the subsequent information.</p>

            <h3><strong>How to Prepare and Submit an Artifact?</strong></h3>

            <p>Your artifact should contain a README file, with a .txt extension. The README file should include seven elements:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>TARGET BADGE: Clarify the badges you are targeting (available, reviewed, reproducible).</li>
                <li>INFO: title of the accepted paper and its submission number, and contact information.</li>
                <li>EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR: what is the artifact intended to do, including a description of its scope and the output it will provide.</li>
                <li>ARTIFACT DESCRIPTION: Explain the content of the artifact, detailing the structure of folders, files, and any other relevant information.</li>
                <li>ENVIRONMENT SETUP: Specify the requirements to run the artifact. This includes minimum RAM, or CPU. If your artifact depends on a specific operating system, you are required to provide a suitable virtualization environment. In any case, we strongly recommend providing a Docker image for ease of access. In such a case, you also need to provide the information on how to run the Docker image.</li>
                <li>GETTING STARTED: Describe how to set up the artifact and validate its general functionality based on a small example data. This setup and execution should ideally take no more than 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>REPRODUCIBILITY: Describes how to reproduce the paper's claims and results in detail.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As a guideline, we recommend that you prepare your submission such that set-up, execution and analysis can be completed within 4 hours.</p>

            <p>The inclusion of all sections depends on the type of artifact you are submitting and the badges you are requesting for review.
                Specifically, the Getting Started section is required for the Reviewed and Reproducible badges, and the Reproducibility Instructions
                section is required for the Reproducible badge.</p>

            <p>Note that it is requested you include a LICENSE file that contains an open-source license, which clearly describes the distribution rights for your project.</p>

            <p>Once you have prepared your artifact, including both the required README file and LICENSE file, upload it to Zenodo or a similar service
                (e.g., figshare) to acquire a DOI. This DOI should be included in both the camera-ready version of your paper and during the artifact submission.</p>

            <p>To submit the artifact for evaluation, use the EasyChair platform. You must upload a copy of the accepted paper that includes
                a <strong>cover page at the beginning</strong>, clearly indicating the <strong>DOI for accessing the artifact</strong>, where
                the README file <strong>MUST</strong> be included and clearly contain all the previously requested information.</p>

            <p>More information about the badges and the best artifact awards follows.</p>

            <p>Available Badge</p>

            <p>To qualify for the Available badge, your artifact must be accessible through a hosting platform. While Zenodo is commonly used and
                recommended for its reliability and integration with scholarly practices, authors are free to choose the platform that best suits
                their needs. Ensure that your artifact is self-contained and versioned during the upload process. Upon upload to your chosen platform,
                a DOI will be generated, which is essential for artifact evaluation submission.</p>

            <p>Kindly note that once submitted, your artifact will be immediately accessible to the public and cannot be modified or deleted.
                However, you retain the option to upload an updated version, which will be assigned a new DOI (e.g., to address reviewer feedback).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, please ensure that your artifact is accompanied by a LICENSE file, clearly outlining the distribution rights. To be eligible
                for badges such as 'Available' or higher, the file must incorporate an open-source license.</p>

            <p>Reviewers will validate the authenticity of the DOI and LICENSE file, and then assess the clarity and comprehensiveness of your
                artifact and README file.</p>

            <p>Reviewed Badge</p>

            <p>Reviewers will evaluate your artifact's fundamental functionality based on the instructions provided in the "Getting Started"
                section of the README file. The Reviewed Badge will be awarded if reviewers can successfully set up the artifact and verify its basic
                functionality using a small sample dataset within 30 minutes.</p>

            <p>Reproducible Badge</p>

            <p>Earning the Reproducible badge entails an additional level of scrutiny. Reviewers will reproduce computational results using your
                research objects, methods, code, and analysis conditions. Therefore, the inclusion of a Reproducibility Instructions section is
                imperative for this badge. Reviewers will conduct a thorough assessment to validate your artifact's support for the paper's primary claims.</p>

            <p>Please note that if reproducing results requires extensive computation or substantial computational resources, reviewers may exercise
                discretion in running experiments. If obtaining results necessitates significant computation time (e.g., days or months), reviewers
                may not be able to reproduce them fully.</p>

            <p>It is crucial to emphasize that clear, detailed documentation and instructions are essential for badge certification.</p>

            <p>Should you require further clarification or assistance, please feel free to contact the AEC Chairs.</p>
