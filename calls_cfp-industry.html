            <h1 class="page-header">Call for Papers - Industry Track</h1>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3><strong>Goal</strong></h3>

            <p>The ISSRE Industry Track aims to establish an informative, practically useful, and effective dialogue between Software Engineering (SE) practitioners and SE researchers on challenges, solutions, findings (both positive and negative), obstacles encountered, and lessons learned on software reliability, assurance, and their improvement. The track is particularly interested in novel techniques and practices in software development, including specification, design, validation, and verification in diverse lifecycle styles, industry sectors, and kinds of software.</p>

            <p>Over the years, the ISSRE Industry Track program has expanded to include a variety of topics including cloud computing, agile development, mobile communications, defect prediction/detection/fixing, release management, defect classification, rejuvenation, security, customer experience/satisfaction, availability, social network analysis, big data analysis, and reliability as well as assurance concerns of the transportation sector (including aviation, road vehicles, rail, and marine), healthcare, telecommunications, as well as other industry sectors that leverage and rely on software.</p>

            <p>Papers submitted to the ISSRE industry track have addressed topics including but not limited to the application of software engineering practices (which may include work on principles, techniques, tools, methods, or processes) to a specific domain or to the development of a substantial software system. Industry track papers are expected to be of interest to software development professionals, as well as to software reliability, software quality, and process improvement groups, with concrete relevance to industrial problems and practical applications. Of additional interest this year are emerging applications that use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, applied in a variety of domains, and their reliability, trustworthiness, and assurance. This can include software reliability for AI, and AI for software reliability.</p>

            <p>The 36th edition of ISSRE will be an in-person event in Sāo Paulo, Brazil. All presenters of accepted papers will be required to attend the conference in person. We aim to encourage wide industry participation.</p>

            <h3><strong> Topics of Interest </strong></h3>

            <h3><strong> Submission guidelines and instructions </strong></h3>

            <p> We invite two kinds of submissions to the Industry Track:  </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Full papers: 6 pages (including references) </li>

                <li> Short papers: 2 pages (including references) </li>

            </ul>

            <p> All the submissions will be reviewed by members of the Industry Track Program Committee. Accepted papers will be included in the ISSRE Supplemental Proceedings and submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore.
            </p>


            <p> Submissions must adhere to the <a class="link-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Computer Society Format Guidelines</a> as implemented by the following LaTeX/Word templates:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a class="link-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/pubs/conference-latex-template_10-17-19.zip">LaTex Package</a> (ZIP)</li>
                <li><a class="link-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/conference-template-a4.docx">Word Template</a> (DOCX)</li>
            </ul>


            <p> Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded. We also strongly recommend that you print the file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations etc.) before submitting it.
            </p>

            <p> Note that: </p>

            <ul>
                <li> A paper must include the title, the name and affiliation of each author, an abstract of up to 150 words, and up to 4 keywords. Thus, submissions are <strong>not</strong> anonymous. </li>

                <li> Reviewers will use the abstract during the bidding process for peer-review. Thus, the abstract should state the paper goals clearly, along with the means used to achieve them. </li>

                <li> The first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (i.e., it has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the total page budget for the paper. </li>

                <li> Symbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed, without requiring on-screen magnification. </li>

                <li> Limit the file size to less than 15 MB. </li>
            </ul>


            <p> <strong>Papers that exceed the page limits specified, on topics not in the scope of ISSRE, or that do not follow the formatting guidelines will be rejected without review.</strong> </p>

            <p> Authors of accepted papers will have the chance to present their work at ISSRE 2025. <strong>Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register for the conference and to give the talk, if the paper is accepted.</strong> </p>


            <h3><strong>Best Paper Awards</strong></h3>

            <p> The Industry Program Chair will select three candidates among top-ranked papers presenting and motivating novel and disruptive ideas that address problems relevant for industry. Selection will be based on the reviewers’ feedback, novelty and potential impact of the results. </p>

            <p> The final selection of the best paper will be done by the audience attending the presentation of the candidate papers. Eligible papers must be (1) full papers accepted to the industry track, and (2) co-authored by at least one author whose primary affiliation is in Industry. </p>
