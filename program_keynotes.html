                        Assuring the reliability of complex systems is a difficult and expensive undertaking.
                        These costs are further exacerbated when a family of similar products with varying features need to be assured,
                        or when products evolve due to changing requirements or to introduce new functionalities. In this talk
                        I will discuss methods for assuring reliability of such systems, from their representation as product lines
                        to their efficient analysis to methods for building and maintaining assurance cases for such systems using templates.

                        The analysis of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly those used
                        as perception modules, is very challenging due to the networks' complex and
                        opaque decision-making processes. Multi-modal Vision-Language Models
                        (VLMs) such as CLIP offer an exciting opportunity to interpret the representation
                        space of vision models using natural language. VLMs have been trained on a
                        large body of images accompanied by their textual description, and are thus
                        implicitly aware of high-level, human-understandable concepts describing the
                        images. In this talk, we report on on-going work that seeks to leverage VLMs for
                        the formal analysis and run-time monitoring of requirements expressed in terms
                        of natural-language concepts, as well as debugging of perception modules.

                    <p class="rtejustify"><span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span>&nbsp;<span class="fst-italic">
                        In an increasingly connected and data-rich world, resilience is no
                        longer just about withstanding failures — it's about adapting, learning, and
                        recovering in real time. At the heart of this evolution lies data: vast, dynamic, and
                        increasingly central to decision-making in secure and dependable systems. But
                        while data-driven strategies have opened new frontiers in threat detection,
                        system adaptation, and anomaly prediction, they have also introduced new
                        vulnerabilities. From training set poisoning in machine learning models to
                        metadata leaks in system logs, data can empower both defenders and
                        adversaries. This keynote explores the paradox of data-driven resilience — how
                        the datasets that enable adaptive defense and fault tolerance can also expose
                        systems to novel attack vectors and privacy breaches. Drawing from real-world
                        case studies, research insights, and lessons from critical infrastructures, we will
                        examine the trade-offs inherent in building resilient systems through data.

                    <p class="rtejustify"><span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span>&nbsp;<span class="fst-italic">
                        The introduction of AI into the developer workflow has fundamentally changed the conversation around productivity, but merely adopting tools is not enough. Drawing on insights from the 2025 DORA State of AI-assisted Software Development report, this keynote argues that AI is an amplifier that magnifies an organization's pre-existing technical and cultural capabilities. It will show why the greatest returns on AI investment come not from the models themselves, but from the maturity of the underlying software delivery system.
We will explore a real-world transformation, using the journey of <a href="https://unico.io">Unico IDTech</a> as a prime example. This story demonstrates how creating a robust and consistent engineering structure (Dev Prime) coupled with a radical shift to user-centric monitoring (SLOs) and reliability engineering created the necessary high-quality Platform foundation. When this foundation is present—characterized by clear governance, healthy data ecosystems, and foundational practices—AI's benefits (such as throughput and organizational performance gains) are dramatically amplified.
This session provides technology leaders with a clear, data-driven mandate: to maximize the value of AI, you must first invest in and rationalize your foundational structure, treating your internal platform as the critical enabler for sustainable AI-driven excellence.

His career spans foundational research and executive leadership in high-growth, high-stakes technology environments.

Currently at Unico IDtech (https://unico.io), where he leads the strategic architectural vision and champions the adoption of world-class software engineering practices across core identity, anti-fraud and high-criticality systems (IDCloud and IDPay). His work has centered on developing robust engineering structures and shifting organizational focus towards user-centric reliability engineering principles, such as Service Level Objectives (SLOs), to manage system dependability at scale.

His experience is marked by periods of immense growth and technical challenge:
Google: Over thirteen years at Google in Brazil. A key contribution was the conception and implementation of Ares, Google's Anti-Abuse infrastructure, designed to handle 2M classifications per second on all Google products. He also contributed to different Google products including Orkut, Google+, Google Books Search, Google News and Google Scholar.
Loggi: As VP of Engineering and Product, he was instrumental in scaling Loggi's logistics platform, driving a 10x growth in delivered packages. This involved leading teams focused on complex optimization algorithms (e.g., dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems), fraud detection, and robust Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices.

Mr. Fonseca holds a Master of Science (MSc) in Computer Science from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), where his research focused on improving query suggestions in search engines. He is deeply committed to combining academic rigor with industry practice to build large, maintainable, and highly reliable systems and cultivate strong engineering organizations.
