                        The analysis of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly those used
                        as perception modules, is very challenging due to the networks' complex and
                        opaque decision-making processes. Multi-modal Vision-Language Models
                        (VLMs) such as CLIP offer an exciting opportunity to interpret the representation
                        space of vision models using natural language. VLMs have been trained on a
                        large body of images accompanied by their textual description, and are thus
                        implicitly aware of high-level, human-understandable concepts describing the
                        images. In this talk, we report on on-going work that seeks to leverage VLMs for
                        the formal analysis and run-time monitoring of requirements expressed in terms
                        of natural-language concepts, as well as debugging of perception modules.
