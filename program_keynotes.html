                        The analysis of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly those used
                        as perception modules, is very challenging due to the networks' complex and
                        opaque decision-making processes. Multi-modal Vision-Language Models
                        (VLMs) such as CLIP offer an exciting opportunity to interpret the representation
                        space of vision models using natural language. VLMs have been trained on a
                        large body of images accompanied by their textual description, and are thus
                        implicitly aware of high-level, human-understandable concepts describing the
                        images. In this talk, we report on on-going work that seeks to leverage VLMs for
                        the formal analysis and run-time monitoring of requirements expressed in terms
                        of natural-language concepts, as well as debugging of perception modules.

                    <p class="rtejustify"><span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span>&nbsp;<span class="fst-italic">
                        In an increasingly connected and data-rich world, resilience is no
                        longer just about withstanding failures — it's about adapting, learning, and
                        recovering in real time. At the heart of this evolution lies data: vast, dynamic, and
                        increasingly central to decision-making in secure and dependable systems. But
                        while data-driven strategies have opened new frontiers in threat detection,
                        system adaptation, and anomaly prediction, they have also introduced new
                        vulnerabilities. From training set poisoning in machine learning models to
                        metadata leaks in system logs, data can empower both defenders and
                        adversaries. This keynote explores the paradox of data-driven resilience — how
                        the datasets that enable adaptive defense and fault tolerance can also expose
                        systems to novel attack vectors and privacy breaches. Drawing from real-world
                        case studies, research insights, and lessons from critical infrastructures, we will
                        examine the trade-offs inherent in building resilient systems through data.

                        Department at Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil. She received
                        her doctorate in Computer Science from the University Pierre et Marie Curie -
                        Sorbonne Université, France. She was on a sabbatical leave at Carnegie Mellon
                        University, USA (2016-2017). Her research interests include wireless networks,
                        network security and dependability. She has worked on providing resilience to
                        self-organized, cognitive and wireless networks by adaptive and opportunistic
                        approaches. Today, her research focuses on creating network security
                        intelligence supported by data science. Dr. Nogueira was one of the pioneers in
                        addressing survivability issues in self-organized wireless networks, being the
                        work “A Survey of Survivability in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks”, one of her prominent
                        scientific contributions. She has been a recipient of Academic Scholarships from
                        Brazilian Government in her undergraduate and graduate years, and of
                        international grants such as from the ACM SIGCOMM Geodiversity program.
                        She served as Associate Technical Editor for the IEEE Communications
